## Challenge 1: Snake Game

### Problem Statement
Create a classic Snake Game where the player controls a snake that grows longer as it eats food. The game ends if the snake collides with the wall or itself.

### Game Mechanics
- The snake moves in a grid and can change direction.
- Food appears randomly on the grid.
- The score increases with each food item consumed.

### Constraints
- The game board is 20x20.
- The snake can only move in four directions (up, down, left, right).
- The snake's initial length is 1.

## Challenge 2: Platform Game

### Problem Statement
Develop a simple 2D platform game where the player navigates through levels, avoiding obstacles and collecting items.

### Game Mechanics
- The player can jump, run, and interact with the environment.
- Levels contain platforms, enemies, and collectibles.

### Constraints
- The game has at least three levels.
- The player can jump a maximum height of 5 units.
- Enemies move back and forth in a fixed pattern.

## Challenge 3: Sudoku

### Problem Statement
Implement a Sudoku solver that can validate and solve any given Sudoku puzzle.

### Game Mechanics
- The player can input a partially filled Sudoku grid.
- The program should output the completed grid or indicate if no solution exists.

### Constraints
- The grid is a standard 9x9 Sudoku format.
- Each row, column, and 3x3 subgrid must contain unique numbers from 1 to 9.

## Challenge 4: Tic Tac Toe with AI

### Problem Statement
Create a Tic Tac Toe game where the player can compete against an AI opponent.

### Game Mechanics
- The player selects 'X' or 'O' and plays against the AI.
- The AI uses a basic strategy to determine its moves.

### Constraints
- The game board is 3x3.
- The AI must be able to win, lose, or draw against the player.

## Challenge 5: Memory Matching

### Problem Statement
Design a memory matching game where players flip cards to find pairs.

### Game Mechanics
- Players take turns flipping two cards at a time.
- If the cards match, they remain face up; otherwise, they are flipped back down.

### Constraints
- The game contains at least 12 cards (6 pairs).
- The time limit for each turn is 30 seconds.

## Challenge 6: Pong Game

### Problem Statement
Create a classic Pong game where two players control paddles to hit a ball back and forth.

### Game Mechanics
- Players control their paddles using keyboard input.
- The game ends when one player fails to return the ball.

### Constraints
- The game board is 800x600 pixels.
- The ball starts with an initial speed of 5 pixels per frame.
